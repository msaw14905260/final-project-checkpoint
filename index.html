        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Dataset: <a href="https://github.com/light-and-salt/World-Bank-Data-by-Indicators/blob/master/gender/gender.csv">World Bank Gender Data</a></p>
    <p>In this project, we aim to analyze global gender disparities across education, labor, and health indicators 
      using a multi-year cross-country dataset. Our goal is to uncover regional patterns, long-term trends, and structural 
      inequalities that affect women and girls worldwide. We will explore relationships between metrics such as literacy 
      rates, labor force participation, adolescent fertility, and children’s employment. Using descriptive analysis and 
      multi-variable comparisons, we will highlight where progress has been made and where gaps persist.
    The final interactive visualization will show gender systems internationally.</p>
